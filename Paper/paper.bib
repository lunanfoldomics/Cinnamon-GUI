abstract = {Cervical cancer, one of the most common fatal cancers among women, can be prevented by regular screening to detect any precancerous lesions at early stages and treat them. Pap smear test is a widely performed screening technique for early detection of cervical cancer, whereas this manual screening method suffers from high false-positive results because of human errors. To improve the manual screening practice, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems have been investigated widely to classify cervical Pap cells. Most of the existing studies require pre-segmented images to obtain good classification results. In contrast, accurate cervical cell segmentation is challenging because of cell clustering. Some studies rely on handcrafted features, which cannot guarantee the classification stage's optimality. Moreover, DL provides poor performance for a multiclass classification task when there is an uneven distribution of data, which is prevalent in the cervical cell dataset. This investigation has addressed those limitations by proposing DeepCervix, a hybrid deep feature fusion (HDFF) technique based on DL, to classify the cervical cells accurately. Our proposed method uses various DL models to capture more potential information to enhance classification performance. Our proposed HDFF method is tested on the publicly available SIPaKMeD dataset and compared the performance with base DL models and the late fusion (LF) method. For the SIPaKMeD dataset, we have obtained the state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 99.85%, 99.38%, and 99.14% for 2-class, 3-class, and 5-class classification. This method is also tested on the Herlev dataset and achieves an accuracy of 98.32% for 2-class and 90.32% for 7-class classification.

  abstract  = {This article provides an update on the global cancer burden using the GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7\%), followed by lung (11.4\%), colorectal (10.0\%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (5.6\%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18\%), followed by colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47\% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64\% to 95\%) versus transitioned (32\% to 56\%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Pap test (PT) interpretations of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), or LSIL-H, are used in many laboratories; however, monitoring its usage for quality assurance purposes is understudied. METHODS: PTs from 2005 to 2010 were collected, and yearly frequencies of LSIL, HSIL, LSIL-H, and atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) as a function of total PTs and total squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) were calculated. Two-year risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN2) or worse (CIN2+) and CIN 3 or worse (CIN3+) was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 352,220 PTs were identified including 17,301 abnormal PTs. LSIL-H usage increased from 2005 to 2010 (from 0.28\% of total PTs in 2005 to 0.61\% in 2010, P < .01; from 5.8\% of total SILs in 2005 to 12\% in 2010, P < .001). HSIL usage decreased significantly from 2005 to 2010 (from 0.7\% of total PTs in 2005 to 0.48\% in 2010, P = .048; from 14.5\% of total SILs in 2005 to 9.5\% in 2010, P < .01). Usage of LSIL and ASC-H did not change. Two-year risk of CIN2+ and CIN3+ for HSIL increased significantly from 2005 to 2010 (P < .01). Two-year risk of CIN2+ and CIN3+ for LSIL-H did not change significantly from 2005 to 2010. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of LSIL-H interpretations is significantly increasing at our institution, with a significant decrease in HSIL interpretations over the same period. Two-year risk of CIN2+ and CIN3+ for HSIL increased significantly as usage of LSIL-H increased and that of HSIL decreased. Laboratories using LSIL-H may benefit from monitoring its frequency to ensure its appropriate use. Cancer (Cancer Cytopathol) 2014;122:123-7. © 2013 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract  = {A recent report that 93 per cent of invasive cervical cancers worldwide contain human papillomavirus (HPV) may be an underestimate, due to sample inadequacy or integration events affecting the HPV L1 gene, which is the target of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test which was used. The formerly HPV-negative cases from this study have therefore been reanalyzed for HPV serum antibodies and HPV DNA. Serology for HPV 16 VLPs, E6, and E7 antibodies was performed on 49 of the 66 cases which were HPV-negative and a sample of 48 of the 866 cases which were HPV-positive in the original study. Moreover, 55 of the 66 formerly HPV-negative biopsies were also reanalyzed by a sandwich procedure in which the outer sections in a series of sections are used for histological review, while the inner sections are assayed by three different HPV PCR assays targeting different open reading frames (ORFs). No significant difference was found in serology for HPV 16 proteins between the cases that were originally HPV PCR-negative and -positive. Type-specific E7 PCR for 14 high-risk HPV types detected HPV DNA in 38 (69 per cent) of the 55 originally HPV-negative and amplifiable specimens. The HPV types detected were 16, 18, 31, 33, 39, 45, 52, and 58. Two (4 per cent) additional cases were only HPV DNA-positive by E1 and/or L1 consensus PCR. Histological analysis of the 55 specimens revealed that 21 were qualitatively inadequate. Only two of the 34 adequate samples were HPV-negative on all PCR tests, as against 13 of the 21 that were inadequate ( p< 0.001). Combining the data from this and the previous study and excluding inadequate specimens, the worldwide HPV prevalence in cervical carcinomas is 99.7 per cent. The presence of HPV in virtually all cervical cancers implies the highest worldwide attributable fraction so far reported for a specific cause of any major human cancer. The extreme rarity of HPV-negative cancers reinforces the rationale for HPV testing in addition to, or even instead of, cervical cytology in routine cervical screening.},
