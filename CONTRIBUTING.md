# Contributing to CINNAMON-GUI

I appreciate your interest in contributing to CINNAMON-GUI! By following these guidelines, you can help us improve the software and make it even more helpful for the community.

## Introduction

CINNAMON-GUI is an open-source tool for classifying biomedical images in digital pathology. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and pre-trained models to identify precancerous cells in Pap smear images. Your collaboration is crucial to improving and expanding the software's functionalities.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check for existing issues:** Before reporting a bug, check if the issue has already been reported [here](link to the issues repository).
2. **Create a new issue:** If the bug has not been reported, open a new issue with a detailed description of the problem, including steps to reproduce it, expected and actual behavior, and any relevant information about the runtime environment.

### Feature Requests

1. **Discuss the idea:** Before implementing a new feature, open an issue to discuss the idea with the project maintainers and the community.
2. **Describe the feature:** Provide a clear description of the proposed feature, including benefits and any potential impacts on existing software.

### Code Contributions

1. **Fork the repository:** Create a fork of the main repository.
2. **Create a branch:** Create a specific branch for the changes you intend to make (`git checkout -b branch-name`).
3. **Write clear and documented code:** Ensure the code is well-documented and follows the project's style guidelines.
4. **Run tests:** Verify that your changes do not break existing tests and add new tests if necessary.
5. **Submit a pull request:** Once the changes are complete, submit a pull request describing the changes made and referencing the associated issue (if any).
